/* Trivia

 * Pointers to structures are generally used as function arguments for reasons
   of efficiency, using const when needed to protect data from unintended
   changes.
   Passing structures by value is most often done for structures that are small
   to begin with, or by passing only the required members of large structures
   individually.
